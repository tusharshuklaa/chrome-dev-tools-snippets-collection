## Introduction
Hey there ___🙌🏻___
<br>
This is a collection of useful/fancy snippets for chrome dev tools. I've picked some of them randomly from the internet 👨🏻‍🎤, some are inspired by some other code on internet 👨🏻‍🔬 and some are purely mine 👨🏻‍🎨

## What is Chrome dev-tools snippets?

In case you haven't heard of chrome dev tools snippets, this is just a way to store some javascript in your browser that you can run on any page via dev tools. You can think of these as a modern alternative of [bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet). Firefox DevTools has a feature similar to Snippets called [Scratchpad](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad). For more information, please checkout [Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/) blog on [Javascript Snippets](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/snippets/).

## Snippets
### Design Mode
Toggles design mode of a web page on or off. When you run the snippet on a page for the first time, it will turn on the Design Mode and will toggle it afterwards. This is helpful in testing a webpage without actually changing content or code. In case you don't know what design mode is, head on to [MDN Docs for design mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/designMode).

## Disclaimer

I'll keep on adding new snippets as I find/write new ones and will add references of original sources as well. Let me know in case I've missed adding any credit for any of the code I'm sharing here. Also, please feel free to open a pull request if you'd like to contribute.
